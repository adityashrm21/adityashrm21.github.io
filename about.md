I am deeply fascinated by research in AI and want to become a part of it and contribute as much as I can to improve the quality of human life and make the world more smart! I am particularly interested in Deep Generative models.

I started this blog for my future self and to help other people interested in this field to understand some common and not-so-common topics in AI!

When I am not coding, you might find me going outdoors or for long runs, or playing guitar!

 If you want to chat or just say Hi!, shoot me an email `adityashrm21 at gmail dot com`. All the open source code that I write is available on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/adityashrm21). Also, let me know about any errors that you find in any blog post and I will be happy to correct them!
